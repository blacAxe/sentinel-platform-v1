# Sentinel Platform v1

Distributed security observability pipeline built with Go, Rust, Kafka-compatible streaming, ClickHouse, and Docker.

Sentinel Platform is a real-time event-driven system designed to simulate how modern security infrastructure detects, processes, transports, and stores security telemetry across distributed services.

The platform demonstrates cross-language backend engineering, asynchronous event pipelines, distributed systems orchestration, and security-focused architecture.

---

# Architecture Overview

The system is composed of multiple independent services communicating through Kafka-compatible event streaming using Redpanda.

## Core Services

| Service | Language | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sentinel Proxy | Go | Reverse proxy + WAF security layer |
| Lumen Agent | Rust | Security event collector and Kafka producer |
| Lumen Ingestor | Go | Kafka consumer + ClickHouse ingestion pipeline |
| Lumen Alerter | Go | Real-time security event monitoring |
| IDP Service | Go | Identity/authentication simulation service |
| Redpanda | Kafka API | Event streaming backbone |
| ClickHouse | Database | High-performance analytics storage |
| PostgreSQL | Database | Identity provider persistence |

# Security Events

The platform simulates real-time security telemetry flowing through a distributed event-driven pipeline.

Current simulated detections include:

- SQL Injection Detection
- Request Blocking
- Security Alert Generation
- Event Streaming
- Real-Time Monitoring
- Persistent Analytics Storage

## Live Security Event Detection

![Security Event](docs/images/security-event.png)

The Rust security agent detects attack activity and publishes structured events into the Kafka-compatible streaming pipeline, where they are consumed by downstream monitoring and analytics services.

---

# Engineering Challenges

One issue encountered during development was distributed service startup ordering inside Docker Compose.

The ingestion service occasionally initialized before Kafka topics were fully created, causing temporary consumer failures during startup.

This was resolved by implementing Kafka topic readiness checks and retry logic inside the ingestion service, allowing the platform to self-recover automatically without requiring manual container restarts.

This improved platform resiliency and orchestration reliability.

# Running the Platform

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd sentinel-platform-v1
```

## Start Services

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

# Testing Security Events

Send a simulated attack event:

## PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST `
  -Uri "http://localhost:7777/event" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"user_id":"omar","attack_type":"sql_injection","action":"blocked"}'
```

---

# Example Output

## Agent

```text
🚨 SECURITY EVENT: user=omar attack=sql_injection
Event shipped to Kafka
```

## Ingestor

```text
Connected to ClickHouse!
Kafka topic ready!
Lumen Ingestor Live! Processing logs...
```

## Alerter

```text
Security Event Detected for User: omar
```

---

# ClickHouse Verification

```sql
USE lumen_db;

SELECT * FROM logs;
```

Example stored event:

```text
service_name : sentinel-proxy
host         : waf-node
level        : SECURITY
message      : sql_injection attack blocked for user omar
user_id      : omar
```
